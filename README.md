# WIP: Multiplayer graph-based data app

[DEMO](https://polda.vercel.app)

The goal of this project is to create a universal interface for popular query
engines/databases/data warehouses.
Kind of like [Ibis](https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis) but for GUI app.

The first version will only support analyzing data stored locally and will be
powered by [Polars](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars).
